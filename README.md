## Running the frontend application
This application's frontend uses Vite as its main build tool.
To run the application with __Node.js__, you can open a terminal in the project's frontend directory, and type 
``` javascript
npm run dev
```
This will allowyou to view the frontend application in the browser. Use the __URL__ provided by the terminal. It should look like this: 
```
http://localhost:5173/
``` 
(Remember that __Ctrl + C__ will stop the running application, i recomend using __leftClick + copy instead__)
