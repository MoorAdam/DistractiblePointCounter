## Running the frontend application
This application's frontend uses Vite as its main build tool.
Vite requires external libraries to run, so you need to install those.
In terminal, navigate to the project directory. There, navigate into the frontend folder, and type
```js
npm install
```
This will download all the necesarry libraries into the __node_mobules__ folder

To run the application with __Node.js__, you can open a terminal in the project's frontend directory, and type 
``` javascript
npm run dev
```
This will allowyou to view the frontend application in the browser. Use the __URL__ provided by the terminal. It should look like this: 
```
http://localhost:5173/
``` 
(Remember that __Ctrl + C__ will stop the running application, i recomend using __leftClick + copy instead__)
